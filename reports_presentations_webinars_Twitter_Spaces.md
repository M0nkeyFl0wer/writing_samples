## Presentations

This slide deck was presented to staff and team members from the City of Jasper for a workshop on consulting hard-to-reach groups using micro-targeting. I later repurposed this presentation as a case study at a conference for public engagement professionals.

## Reports

These two reports are from public engagements I coordinated for [Ethelo](https://www.ethelo.com/):

- One for the **Hailzaqv First Nation** to develop a clean energy plan
- The other for a **cross-country engagement** aimed at influencing the federal budget on behalf of major Canadian foundations

Both campaigns included targeted digital outreach and community consultation.
