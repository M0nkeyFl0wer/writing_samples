<p>Dear friend,</p>
<p>As we near election day on Monday, I find myself thinking about a particular moment: the moment of marking a ballot. It’s private, weighty, and deeply personal. A quiet act, but one that echoes through our politics, our communities, even our history.</p>
<p>And if you’re someone who’s been wondering how to cast your vote in Vancouver Centre this time, I want to speak to you not as Avi’s father, but as someone who has spent a lifetime in the public square, trying to speak truthfully — and to listen with humility.</p>

<p>You may be considering voting for the Liberal candidate to prevent something worse. I understand that instinct. I’ve known it myself in other races, other decades. But I’d like to offer some clarity that may help to cut through the campaign noise.</p>
<p><strong>Vancouver Centre is not a two-horse race between Liberals and Conservatives.</strong> It never has been, not even at the peak of Stephen Harper’s power. Through all the twists and turns of federal politics, the New Democrats have consistently placed second here — often with strength and momentum. <strong>The Conservatives have remained a distant third. In fact, Vancouver Centre has not elected a Conservative MP since the Cold War.</strong></p>
<p>And while we’re talking history, remember that Hedy Fry has been the MP in this riding since 1993. To put it in perspective: when she was elected I was younger then than Avi is now.</p>
<p><strong>Thirty-two years is a long time.</strong></p>
<p>And while I honour Dr. Fry’s decades of public service, I believe this is a moment that calls for a different kind of leadership. A bolder voice. A generational shift.</p>
<p>Now, I know some folks like to quote 338Canada or other election projection websites. But I would gently caution against taking those projections as gospel. In past elections — especially here in B.C. — those predictions have missed the mark by a wide margin. They often rely on national trends and polling firms of, shall we say, uneven reputation. What they can’t measure is the energy of local campaigns. The power of a candidate who’s out there, every day, knocking doors and sparking something real.</p>
<p>And Avi is doing just that.</p>
<p><strong>This campaign is building something extraordinary.</strong> Not just opposition, but a vision: for public healthcare that includes Pharmacare and mental health; for climate action that isn’t captured by oil lobbyists; for homes people can actually afford to live in.</p>

<p>I don’t write to tell you how to vote. That moment belongs to you, and you alone; but I do want you to have the full picture. Because <strong>voting isn’t just about avoiding the worst — it’s about choosing the best we can do together.</strong> And in this riding, in this moment, I believe that choice is Avi.</p>
<p>With deep respect and great hope,</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Lewis</strong></p>
<p><em>P.S. When you mark your ballot, I hope you’ll feel what I feel watching Avi on the trail: not fear of what could go wrong — but excitement for what we still have time to make right.</em></p>
