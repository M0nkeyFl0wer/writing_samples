**Dear Friend,**

With just days left before Election Day, Iâ€™m honoured to share a lovely personal message from Chief Rueben George recorded this weekend on why heâ€™s supporting me in this critical campaign for Vancouver Centre.

Rueben has spent his life fighting for land, climate, and justice. Heâ€™s seen firsthand how rare it is to have elected leaders who truly show up â€” who donâ€™t just make promises, but walk the walk.

For generations, First Nations communities have faced governments who talk reconciliation but act in self-interest. Rueben knows that I would be a true ally in Parliament.

This endorsement means the world to me â€” and Iâ€™m asking you to help us finish strong.

**If youâ€™re able to chip in to help us reach more voters in these critical final days, [please give what you can here](https://www.voteavi.ca/donate-rueben).**

We are so close to a fully funded campaign that maximizes the amount we are allowed to spend. Every single dollar helps us connect with undecided voters and push back against right-wing misinformation about vote splitting.

With your help, we can finish strong with this honest and hopeful campaign grounded in justice.

**Letâ€™s win this thing!**
