## Statement on Fire at Nicholson Towers:  
## Feds “Missing in Action” on Seniors Housing

**VANCOUVER, B.C.** – Avi Lewis, NDP federal candidate for Vancouver Centre, today issued the following statement in response to the devastating fire at Nicholson Towers, which displaced 42 residents—many of them seniors with mobility challenges.

> “This fire is a tragic and preventable disaster—one that lays bare the consequences of federal neglect. Nicholson Towers was built to provide supportive housing for seniors, exactly the kind of housing we need more of as our population ages. Instead of maintaining and expanding it, the federal government is missing in action — as a result, even the most basic safety measures are missing too.”

> “Think about this: the last federal investment in Nicholson Towers was in 2009—15 years ago. That funding installed fire alarms, but no sprinklers. In 2025, firefighters are pointing to the lack of sprinklers as a key reason this fire was so destructive. The message could not be clearer: without the backstop of federal funding, our elders are not being kept safe.”

> “This isn’t just about one building—it’s a nationwide pattern. The Federal Government—the force that once built public housing across this country—has withdrawn with disaster consequences. Ottawa has abandoned public housing to piecemeal funding and short-term fixes.”

Lewis also pointed to the impact of offloading responsibility and financial pressures on non-profit housing providers:

> “A decade ago responsibility for Nicholson Towers was offloaded to a non-profit. Saddled with the costs of maintaining an aging building, that organization was brought in higher-paying tenants. The result? Seniors—who this housing was originally built for—are feeling increasingly unsafe in their own homes.”

> “This is what happens when Ottawa fails to invest in public housing. When housing providers are left scrambling for funds, safety and security are the first casualties.”

Lewis called for urgent federal action, emphasizing that seniors’ housing must be treated as essential infrastructure:

> “Our senior neighbours deserve better. They built this country. They made the sacrifices that created the public services and communities we cherish. They deserve to age in dignity and security—not in buildings that become death traps.”

> “We need a care and repair plan for social housing—one that funds deep retrofits and essential safety upgrades, including heat pumps to protect vulnerable neighbours from climate-fueled heat waves, and yes, fire sprinklers in every single building.”

> “Instead of one-time funding announcements from two decades ago, we need a real, sustained commitment to maintaining and expanding public and non-market housing. That means treating homes for low-income seniors and other vulnerable neighbours as critical infrastructure—not an afterthought.”
