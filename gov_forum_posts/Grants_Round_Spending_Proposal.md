# 🗳️ GG19 Matching Fund Proposal

A big thank you to [@Sov](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/sov), [@azeem](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/azeem), and [@connor](https://gov.gitcoin.co/u/connor), as well as everyone else on the Grants Program Team for your help on this proposal for discussion.

---

## **TLDR**

- We are proposing we set the matching funds for the Program Rounds in GG19 as follows:
  - $200,000 for the **Web3 OSS round**
  - $200,000 for the **Web3 Community and Education round**
  - $200,000 for the **Core Ethereum Infrastructure round**
- This will be offset by funds raised before payouts are complete.
- After our post-round review is completed, we will post the round results here on the gov forum as we have done in the past.
- We will allow the community **one week of discussion and feedback before payouts are made**.
- **Fundraising efforts are underway**, and we are inviting the community to help support program rounds.
- Funds can be sent directly to these ENS addresses:
  - `GitcoinOSS.eth`
  - `GitcoinCommunity.eth`
  - `GitcoinETHInfra.eth`

## **Issues for Discussion**

Given the ongoing bear market, it's important we ensure **builders have access to funding** to continue building for the long term.

Fundraising continues to be a challenge, although **some core funders remain active** and new opportunities are being explored.

We are requesting these funds **in advance** of the round to:

- Speed up the process of releasing matching funds at the end of rounds.
- Increase transparency.
- Avoid a formal snapshot vote post-round.

We will **update this thread** as funds are raised by both the **Grants Program Team** and community.

We’re also exploring ways to **decentralize fundraising**, in alignment with Gitcoin’s progressive decentralization strategy.

## **Current Status of Matching Funds Pool**

Gitcoin currently holds approximately **8,917 ETH (~$16,000,000)** in its public goods multisig at `Gitcoin.eth`.

> **Note:** This does not include fiat or funds held on other networks.

If we allocated **$1M per round**, the funds would last for **16 more quarterly rounds (4 years)** at current values. Historically, Gitcoin has often raised more than needed, increasing the fund pool over time—thanks to contributions like **MoonShotBots**, **The Greatest LARP**, **Akita**, and others.

However, **fundraising is harder in the bear market**, especially with more and larger pools required.

## **How Can the Community Get Involved?**

To support **public goods funding**, we are calling on the community to:

- Donate directly to these ENS addresses:
  - 🛠 `GitcoinOSS.eth` (Web3 OSS)
  - 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 `GitcoinCommunity.eth` (Web3 Community & Education)
  - 🏗 `GitcoinETHInfra.eth` (Core Ethereum Infrastructure)
