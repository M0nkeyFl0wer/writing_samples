# 🌱 Supercharging GG20 with Thrive Protocol

Hey everyone! I’m so excited to tell you all about this plan. As you may know, I’ve now been involved in running the last 9 grants program rounds at Gitcoin. In that time, we’ve tried a lot of nifty experiments, but this one feels like the culmination of all that and more.

To put it shortly: we have an idea for how to “supercharge” GG20 and maximize the impact and effectiveness of the round with a mix of strategic incentives and feedback loops using Thrive Protocol. (Spoiler: I now work for Thrive Protocol while continuing to advise the Gitcoin Grants Lab team.)

---

## TL;DR

- We plan to provide incentives for grantees, round operators, and community members during GG20 using **ARB tokens** and **Thrive Points** (redeemable at Thrive DAO’s launch this summer).
- These bonuses will come from Thrive Protocol on behalf of Arbitrum DAO, targeting OSS and community rounds that meet funding criteria.

---

## 🟢 During GG20

- Grantees and community members can claim rewards for posting about projects they’ve supported.
- Bonuses will be awarded for top posts (based on reviews + social metrics).
- Token rewards for hosting Twitter Spaces with other grantees.
- Rewards for producing onboarding content.

## 🟡 After GG20

- Round operators can earn incentives based on timeliness and community evaluations.
- Grantees will be rewarded for milestone updates using Karma.
- Continued work and consistency (across GG21, GG22, GG23) will also be rewarded.

## 📌 More Details

**Thrive Protocol** helps decentralized communities grow by combining incentives with structured evaluation. We’ll use a rubric assessed by both experts and community members.

Key rubric factors:
- Timely milestone execution
- Expert review (especially for code)
- Community adoption and use
- Overall quality of work

A huge thank you to Sejal, Sov, Mathilda, Meg, Laura, and everyone at Gitcoin and Thrive. This is a true community-driven effort!

## 🎯 Goals

- Increase participation, project quality, and verified impact
- Reduce friction for grantees, donors, and round operators
- Strengthen long-term partnerships between Gitcoin and Arbitrum DAO

## 💰 Funding Specifics

**As part of the Thank ARB campaign:**

- $100k ARB for OSS round matching
- $150k ARB for matching funds for eligible community rounds
- $100k bonus for OSS projects using Orbit or Arbitrum Nova

**Total Matching: ~240,000 ARB (~$350,000 USD)**

## 🚀 Implementation Plan

We're rewarding *all three sides* of the quadratic funding triangle:

- **Grantees**
- **Round Operators**
- **Supporters / Voters**

Using incentives + attestation data + validation loops to build trust, increase retention, and supercharge the QF flywheel.
