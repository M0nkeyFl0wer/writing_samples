# Mid-program Retro

![Thank ARB pluralistic grants program](https://canada1.discourse-cdn.com/flex029/uploads/arbitrum1/optimized/2X/5/567c7bb5a836162703fb232035a361e8b098df72_2_690x388.jpeg)

## Summary

We are very excited to have reached a pivotal moment in the pluralistic grants program, Thank ARB Milestone 1(b). To date, we have approved 8 grant programs through our RFP process and 3 grant projects via our Firestarters program sourced from over 200 applications. We also made significant steps towards decentralizing the review process, with 50+ reviewers from the Arbitrum community.

On a personal note I wanted to take a moment to say how proud I am to be part of this extended community that genuinely values decentralization and is excited to explore innovative mechanisms for the allocation of funds. This grants program is attracting a wide range of visionary ideas and it was truly painful to not be able to fund more of them. We have so many fantastic ideas coming forward, trusting in the community to do the assessment of which projects to fund felt like a leap of faith at times but an important one.

In truth I may have personally selected one or two different proposals that I was excited by but that is the beautiful thing about harnessing the wisdom of the crowd. It's not the views of any one person that matter, it's the collective wisdom that is most important. At the end of the day all the projects that were shortlisted could have done amazing things and I hope we are able to fund many more similar projects that are inspired by the process in the months ahead.

This document outlines key learnings from the M1b application and review process, which ran from April to June 2024. Where possible, some of these takeaways have already been applied, while others are highlighted for future implementation. Please share your thoughts and feedback in the comments section below. Building in public is important and we welcome your ideas and observations.

## RFP overview

We published an open call for applicants on the [Arbitrum DAO Forum](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/launching-an-rfp-process-for-innovative-grant-programs-and-managers/23270) and [Twitter](https://x.com/ThankArbitrum/status/1781309105069855232) looking for grant ideas. We were focused on funding a plurality of allocation methodologies to test with the Arbitrum community.

## Program idea applications

- These applications were screened by the Thank ARB team.  
- We received 120 program idea applications, of which 64 (53%) passed screening.  
- 26 of the 64 (41%) scored high enough on our rubric to be considered strong applicants.  

After deliberating on more difficult to quantify criteria such as risk of failure and applicant background checks, we selected 22 applicants to receive a 1,000 ARB planning grant to refine their proposal before making a final selection.

## Planning grants

In contrast to M1a, M1b piloted planning grants as part of the program applicant cycle. The thinking behind this draws on best practices established in the traditional grants industry...

We gave out 22 planning grants and hosted [2x workshops](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/planning-grants-workshops-hosted-by-thank-arb/24535) geared towards helping applicants refine their allocation mechanism, metrics, and execution plan.

## Program manager applications

Note: These applications were initially to fill gaps in programs missing a manager, but all shortlisted programs already had one.

- We received 62 program manager applications.  
- 49 (79%) passed screening.  
- 44 were approved as qualified candidates.  
- 23 of the 44 (52%) scored 5/5 on our rubric.  

## Final program applications

- Each application was reviewed by at least 5 community reviewers.  
- Minimum criteria: 7/12 total score AND at least 3/5 “approve” votes.  
- 8 programs were selected for funding.

## General takeaways

- Better communication about what M1b was intended for.
- Clearer distinction between project vs program applicants.
- Transparency improvements in application visibility and summaries.
- More structured, targeted application questions.
- Adopted -3 to +3 rubric for better signal and disagreement tracking.

## Review process & methodology

### Stage 1: Screening
Filtered out spam, AI junk, and clearly off-topic submissions.

### Stage 2: Community reviews

**Reviewer tiers:**
- Tier 1: 100 ARB/review (subject-matter experts)  
- Tier 2: 10 ARB/review (skilled, less contextual)  
- Tier 3 (planned): 1 ARB/review for screeners  

**Tasks:**
1. Score each applicant from -3 to +3  
2. Vote yes/no on funding  
3. Rank applicants  

We’re testing a feedback loop where reviewer alignment with consensus earns points toward tier promotion.

### Stage 3: Aggregating scores

**To be funded, an applicant needed:**
- A median score of at least 7/12  
- A majority "yes" vote (≥ 3/5 reviewers)  

### Stage 4: Communicating decisions

Each applicant was informed of next steps, with AI-generated summaries now available.
