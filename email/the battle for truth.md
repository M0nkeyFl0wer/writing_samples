**Hi friend,**

We’re in a national election at a time when democracy itself is under attack. Coordinated, malicious disinformation campaigns are manipulating our conversations, our communities, and our digital spaces. The far right is organizing. Corporate power is eroding truth, trust, and our very ability to act together. And local voters here in Vancouver Centre are feeling overwhelmed and unsure how to respond.

That’s why I’m hosting this urgent conversation about how we fight back.

This isn’t just theory. It’s not an academic exercise. It’s about defending our neighbours, our shared future, and the truth — right here in Vancouver Centre, where the election for your next MP is *already* underway.

**Space is limited — [RSVP now](https://www.voteavi.ca/democracy_talks)**.  
Let’s fight for what’s real. See you Sunday.

In passionate solidarity,
