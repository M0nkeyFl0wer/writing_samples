# ✍️ Writing Samples – Ben West (he/they)  

Hi there, I’m Ben, a writer and strategist with 25 years of experience helping movements, campaigns, and tech teams communicate with clarity and purpose. I’ve led comms for climate justice efforts, open-source platforms, and public interest tools, always focused on making complex systems feel human.

This repo collects writing samples aligned with the Bluesky Senior Communications Manager role. Each piece reflects a core belief: language should open doors, not reinforce silos, and storytelling is infrastructure too.
