# ✍️ Writing Samples – Ben West (he/they)  

Hi there — I’m Ben, a writer and strategist with 25 years of experience working at the intersection of activism, tech, and public infrastructure. I’ve led comms for climate campaigns, helped launch open-source tools, and worked with teams building the future of digital trust and identity.

This repo includes a selection of writing samples aligned with the kinds of work outlined in Bluesky’s Senior Communications Manager role, all rooted in the idea that language should make systems more accessible.
